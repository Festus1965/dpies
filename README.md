# D Pies

This is a fairly simple mod that adds highly nutritious apple and meat pies. Mobs redo and Big Trees are recommended.

Uncooked apple pies can be made with two apples, a flour, and either three syrup or one honey or one bucket of milk. Meat pies require two raw meat, an onion, and a flour. They must be baked to be edible.

Onions can be gathered from tall grass, and grown like any other crop. There are no onion seeds -- just plant an onion.
